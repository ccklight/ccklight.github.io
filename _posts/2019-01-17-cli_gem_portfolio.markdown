'#CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project-Oprahs' Favorite Things'.
This is a Ruby project in fulfillment of my first of five projects for my portfolio for Flatiron School. It is called “CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project” and entails building a Ruby gem that provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) to an external data source. According to the project details, the CLI will be composed of an Object Oriented Ruby application. While the project also states that we students will use all we’ve learned about Ruby and CLI Applications in Ruby to complete this project, my approach is to keep it simple and lean by not getting mired by unnecessary complexity.  

I initially started this project in mid-November 2018, focusing on a triathlon website.  After several missteps, I changed to a more scrape-able site.  The initial Oprah magazine was Javascript heavy and was not amenable to scraping, so my Tech Lead suggested another site which would be better.  I encountered the most difficulty in setting up the bin directory and the CLI, despite copious study, re-watching videos, and re-doing lessons and labs.  Once that interplay was achieved, I was able to create OO objects for my program.
